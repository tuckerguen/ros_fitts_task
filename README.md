# ROS Motion Capture Fitts Task
ROS package that can be used in conjunction with the 
[polaris_sensor package](https://github.com/tuckeruen/polaris_sensor). You can use the instructions there
to run that node and stream data from the Polaris Vicra to a ROS topic. Make sure to use the correct rom file. For this
project: ***rom/fitts_tool.rom***  

Then run this node to perform the actual human trial data collection.
